# Matrix-Factorization-for-Time-Series-Forecasting

## Problem statement
We need to build a forecasting model to forecast the electricity load of different clients (i.e., forecasting multiple time series at once) for a certain period in the future.

## About the algorithm
This algorithm is known as `Multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis (mSSA)`. This is a matrix factorization based method that can help in -
- Time-series forecasting and
- Time series imputation

The python library to use this algorithm is not currently present in PyPi. The code repository is present in this GitHub repository: https://github.com/AbdullahO/mSSA. So we will be using a different way to install the library on your local machine. Below we have provided the steps to follow to install this library.
